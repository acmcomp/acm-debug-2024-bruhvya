# Q7: Frontend HTML/JS Issue (Medium)
hidden css and added toggle in script to activate . chucked random if else ladder

## Problem

The following code is supposed to toggle the visibility of a paragraph when a button is clicked, but it's not working:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Toggle Visibility</title>
</head>
<body>
  <button id="toggle-btn">Toggle Paragraph</button>
  <p id="text">This is a paragraph.</p>

  <script>
    document.getElementById("toggle-btn").addEventListener("click", function() {
      const paragraph = document.getElementById("text");
      if (paragraph.display === "none") {
        paragraph.display = "block";
      } else {
        paragraph.display = "none";
      }
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Expected Behavior:**
Clicking the button should toggle the visibility of the paragraph.

**Current Behavior:**
The paragraph doesn't hide or show when the button is clicked.
